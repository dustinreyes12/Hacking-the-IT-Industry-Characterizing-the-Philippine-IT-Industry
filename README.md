# Hacking the IT Industry: Characterizing the Philippine IT Industry
Work related to the dataset obtained from several job-posting sites in the Philippines. We focused on job posts related to the IT industry.

The increase in popularity of digitalization, the continuous technological advancements and the emergence of artificial intelligence have made jobs from the IT industry to be one of the most in-demand in the Philippines. 

To meet said demand, this study aims to discover the skills needed to be hired in the IT industry. Using data gathered from several job-posting sites, Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) method was used to cluster and pinpoint the relevant competencies needed for IT jobs in the country. 

Results show that as of June 2019, the IT industry in the Philippines has 23 clusters based on the required skill set, with skills related to financial technologies being the most popular.
